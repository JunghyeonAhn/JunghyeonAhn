## ü§ö Self Introduction
<p align="justify"> <!-- Ï§ÑÎ∞îÍøà </p> Ïù¥Í±∞Îûë Í∞ôÏù¥ ÏÇ¨Ïö© -->
I was a Junior Data Analyst with a background in CX and a strong focus on improving customer experience through data. Starting my career in a startup, I moved beyond simple operations to design data-driven workflows that directly impacted business outcomes. Key achievements include reducing refund rates by 50% (5.5% ‚Üí 2.7%) through workflow redesign, building a full GA4 + GTM tracking infrastructure (79 events, 21 triggers) for a new service, and automating repetitive CX processes with Google Apps Script, cutting processing time from 5 minutes to 16 seconds.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, GA4, and Excel, applying them to EDA, funnel analysis, and RFM segmentation in both bootcamp projects and real-world work. My approach combines structured problem-solving (MECE, hypothesis testing) with agile collaboration.
</p>
Looking ahead, I aim to leverage my hybrid expertise in CX and data analytics to deliver actionable insights that drive customer engagement and organizational growth. My Github Porfile will showcases diverse MySQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, Data analystics projects that represent my tech abitlities and analyzing abliltiy.
